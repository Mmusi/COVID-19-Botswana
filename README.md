#Exploring Data Science - Road to being a Story Teller 

Here I will start by working with the current situation: the ongoing pandemic COVID-19

With this notebook I will explore and learn different ways and techniques of Python pgrogramming, Data Science to further hone my Analysis skills.
I will try to do what Data Scientists call as munging as Data is not easily available in Botswana... Lost well Data Munging is collecting RAW DATA from different sources to process it so it becomes more appropriate and valuable. That is right follow me as i embark on my journey to become a story teller!

Although when going through the learning processes I will be preparing for the IBM Cognos Analytics Author Certification exam before end of year 2020;

I will mostly be using opensource Data Science tools such as Python, Zeppellin And Jupyter Notebooks.

I will start by trying to track COVID-19 in Botswana though data is not easily available here, hopefully my DATA MUNGING skils will take a serious sharpening as a result.. Hopefully my notebooks will be testament to such.
