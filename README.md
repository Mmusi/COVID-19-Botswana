Exploring Data Science - Road to being a Story Teller

Here I will start by working with the current situation: the on-going pandemic COVID-19
With this notebook I will explore and learn different ways and techniques of Python programming, Data Science to further horn my analysis skills.
I will try to do what Data Scientists call as munging as data is not easily available in Botswana... In simple terms Data Munging is the collecting of RAW DATA from different sources to process it so it becomes more appropriate and valuable. With this repository I hope it will serve as my track and gauge as I go along the route of mastering Data Analysis..
It would be my pleasure to have anyone interested in the field follow me along the way to my becoming a story teller!
Although when going through the learning processes I will be preparing for the IBM Cognos Analytics Author Certification exam before end of year 2020:
â€¢	I will solely be using open source Data Science tools such as Python, Zeppelin and Jupyter Notebooks.
I will start by trying to track COVID-19 in Botswana though data is not easily available here, hopefully my DATA MUNGING skills will take a serious sharpening as a result. Hopefully my notebooks will be testament to such.
