    "A quick look around the internet, one will pick up alot of dashboards as well as data around the Corona Virus ependicmic. Many Data Scientists are trying to use Data Science to give their expert opiions and contribute to the “flattening of the curve”. As a new  entrant to the field of Data Analysis am fascinated by all these different strategies used by different countries from social distancing , lockdown amongst others. It is clear these strategies most are based on decisions partly arrived at by Data Scientists.\n",

So far I have been failing to get any except from the little numbers that I get over the radio or when ministers brief the nation on National Television – BTV. This frustrate me so much that I am now trying to create my own COVID-19 Dataset and even go a step further by modelling it before presenting the data visually using my foundational knowledge.\n",
